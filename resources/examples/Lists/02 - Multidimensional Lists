#* Multidimensional Lists

##
((1, 2), (3, 4));
#* A multidimensional list of one or more lists within a list
##

##
(1, 2; 3, 4);
#* Semicolons can also be used to delimit lists within a list
##

##
(1; 2; 3; 4, 5);
#* Lists with one element are flattened
#* Here the first three lists are flattened because they only have one element
##

##
say (1, 2, 3, (5, 6; 7, 8, (9, 10)))
#* Lists nested to any level and semis can parentheses can be mixed to generate the multidimensional list
