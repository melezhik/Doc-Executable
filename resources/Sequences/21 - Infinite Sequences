#* Infinite Sequences

#* Sequences do not have to have a defined last element. They can go on forever.

0 ... 100000000000000000000000000000000000000;
#* Sequences can handle a very large series of numbers
#* Even though this Sequence is huge, it's still created almost instantly. This is because the Sequence isn't generated until it's used.

#0 ... *;
#0 ... Inf;

#* Sequences can even go to infinity
#* Unlike sequences with a defined end point, an infinite series will cause your computer to enter an infinite loop.
# The lines above are commented out to prevent an infinite loop.
