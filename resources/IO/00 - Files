#* IO: Files

#* Examples for working with files

##
slurp('path/to/file').say
#* Print the contents of file followed by a newline
##

##
my $file-content = slurp 'some-file'
#* Assign the content of a file to a scalar variable
##

##
my $fh = open "LICENSE.txt";
say $fh.WHAT;
##
#* Create a file handle from a string
#* A file handle is an object that is a reference to a directory or a file on your computer's system.
# In the code above, we assign a file handle to a scalar, named '$fh', using the open command.
# 'open' is one of Raku's so-called "independent" routines, in that it does
# not belong to any class or role. We pass a string, 'LICENSE' to the 'open' routine.
# The 'open' routine then coerces the string to an IO object and creates a handle to the file.
# This method succeeds whether even if file or directory name "LICENSE" does not exist.
##


##
my $fh = open "testfile", :r;
##
#* File handle options
#* The 'open' routine also accepts a variety of option flag arguments.
# Here, we pass it the :r option, which tells the 'open' routine to
# open the file for a "read" operation.
##

##
my $fh = open "testfile", :r;
my $content = $fh.slurp
